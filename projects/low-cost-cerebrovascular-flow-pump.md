title: Low-Cost Cerebrovascular Flow Pump
---

## Overview
This project involved the independent design and development of a low-cost pulsatile flow pump system to simulate physiologically realistic cerebrovascular blood flow for interventional neuroradiology training and experimental research applications.

Typically assigned to a four-person team, the project was executed independently and focused on achieving accurate flow and pressure dynamics using accessible components and a modular, research-oriented system architecture.

---

## Motivation
Commercial cerebrovascular flow simulators are often prohibitively expensive and inaccessible for many academic and training environments. The objective of this project was to design a cost-effective alternative (approximately \$600 total system cost, ~75% lower than comparable professional systems) capable of replicating key hemodynamic characteristics of cerebral arteries while supporting future experimental expansion.

## System Architecture & Design
The system integrates mechanical, electrical and computational components to achieve controlled pulsatile flow:

- Peristaltic stepper motor pump driven by an Arduino-based control architecture  
- Real-time flow sensing and signal processing for monitoring system behavior  
- Integration with a 3D-printed Circle of Willis vascular model  
- Use of a glycerol–water mixture as a blood analog to approximate physiological viscosity  

Custom control logic was implemented to regulate flow rate and pressure behavior, enabling the simulation of physiologically relevant cerebrovascular conditions.

## Flow Modeling & Data Analysis
Physiological flow and pressure dynamics were modeled and evaluated using fundamental fluid mechanics principles, including Poiseuille’s Law. Flow sensor data were collected and analyzed to validate system performance and repeatability under controlled experimental conditions.
