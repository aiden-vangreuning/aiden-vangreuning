## Hi, I’m Aiden Van Greuning.

I’m a Biomedical Engineering graduate with hands-on experience across experimental system design, signal processing, and applied biomedical research. My work includes developing a low-cost cerebrovascular flow pump for interventional neuroradiology training, alongside experience in wet-lab techniques, computational analysis, microscale biomedical systems and radiation-based medical technologies.

I’m broadly interested in biomedical research and engineering — spanning medical devices, radiation therapy and medical physics, cell and tissue engineering, BioMEMS and molecular-scale technologies — with a focus on translating theory into practical, accessible solutions.
